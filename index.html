<h1>About Diana</h1>
<p>Always having fun and constantly hanging out with my friends, I am the typical 14 year old teenage girl. I am going to be attending Lynbrook Highschool at the start of the school year as a freshman. With a hardworking and determined mindset, I tend to try my best only on the things I enjoy. My family includes my mother, father, sister, and dog. Some things I enjoy doing are the following: </p>
     
<ul>
    <li>drinking boba</li>
    <li>gossiping with friends</li>
    <li>checking instagram</li>
    <li>photography</li>
    <li>shopping</li>
    <li>watching netflix</li>
    <li>eating</li>
   
</ul>

<h2>What is my Passion?</h2>
<p>Dance is a form of art where you incorporate the movement of your body and move to the rhythm of the music. Dancing is my passion because it allows me to forget about the stress that school brings, like homework and tests.</p>
